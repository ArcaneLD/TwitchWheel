TwitchWheel Is a plugin that uses twitch4j to react to subs,cheers,subgifts and follows.

Whith this plugin you have 3 different wheels that can be automatically(subs,subgifts,ect..) launched, semi-automatically and manually launched, there's is over 50 effects in the plugin

(I had to speedrun this one for a customer so the code is a bit dirty)


I should have used an enum for the effects of the spins, but I worked on this with peoples that didn't knew/understood this process so I did it this way even tho it's less optimized and less readable so that everyone can work on the code
